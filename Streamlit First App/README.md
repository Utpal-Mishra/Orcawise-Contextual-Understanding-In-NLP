# CONTEXTUAL LANGUAGE UNDERSTANIDNG

LANGUAGE USED: 
 - Python

LIBRARIES USED:
 - streamlit, re, numpy, pandas, sklearn and stylecloud

ABOUT:
 - A Streamlit Web Application is build to showcase the interpretations and analysis on Bi-Grams and Tri-Grams.

 - The Application containes 4 web pages:
	Page 1: Home
	Page 2: Uni-Grams
	Page 3: Bi-Grams
	Page 4: Tri-Grams


Page 1:
 - Display a brief information about the web application. 

Page 2:
 - The page is based on making interpretation for the Uni-Grams.
 - To make analysis of the respective collcations, a text (.txt) is required to be uploaded - stored locally - using the "Choose Files" Buttom. 
 - Once the file is uploaded, data preprocessing is performed on the textual data and, a DataFrame is formed and it can be witnessed using the Checkbox.
 - Further, to visualize a Uni-Gram, plotly library is used to plot a barplot.
 - Lastly, based on the frequency of occurance of the texts a wordcloud is showcased.

Page 3:
 - The page is based on making interpretation for the Bi-Grams.
 - To make analysis of the respective collcations, a text (.txt) is required to be uploaded - stored locally - using the "Choose Files" Buttom. 
 - Once the file is uploaded, data preprocessing is performed on the textual data and, a DataFrame is formed and it can be witnessed using the Checkbox.
